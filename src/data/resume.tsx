    "Frontend Developer specializing in ReactJS with 3 Years of Experience & overall 7 Years of Experience, aspiring to become a MERN Stack Engineer",
  summary:
    "I began my career as an Instrumentation Engineer, providing database reporting solutions for power plants integrated with Automation Systems (PLC/SCADA). During this time, although I have completed many Automation Systems successfully, I realised my coding skill surpasses my skills in developing automation systems. With encouragement and guidance from friends, I transitioned into software field as a Frontend Developer.\n\n My Software career started in a company that specializes in building cloud portals for managing solar portfolios. This role improved my frontend development skills and allowed me to leverage my in-depth knowledge of solar power plants to enhance our product features.\n\n After 2 years, I wanted to explore the Healthcare domain & joined a company where I am actively involved in application development as a frontend-heavy MERN stack developer. I am working on ExpressJS for implementing RESTAPI Endpoints, handling the manual deployment for both Frontend & Backend Apps & currently working on CI/CD implementation with Jenkins with SonarQube Integration",
